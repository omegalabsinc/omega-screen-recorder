---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ (latest stable recommended)
- ffmpeg installed and available in PATH
  - macOS: `brew install ffmpeg`
  - Windows: Install from `https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/` and add to PATH
- Platform-specific build tools:
  - **macOS**: Xcode Command Line Tools
  - **Windows**: Visual Studio Build Tools

### Build

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/screenrec --help
```

### Example CLI Interface

Your CLI might look something like this:

```bash
# Take a screenshot
screenrec screenshot --output ~/Desktop/screenshot.png

# Record with microphone (Make sure you read the notes on audio mentioned below.)
#macOS (defaults to built-in mic :1 on macOS)
screenrec record --output video.mp4 --audio mic --fps 30
#windows (default microphone)
screenrec.exe record --output video.mp4 --audio mic --fps 30

# Record with microphone using explicit device
#macOS
screenrec record --output video.mp4 --audio mic --audio-device ":1" --fps 30
#windows
screenrec.exe record --audio mic --audio-device "audio=Microphone Array (Intel® Smart Sound Technology for Digital Microphones)" --fps 30 --resolution 1920X1080 --output .\video_demo.mp4

# Record video with system audio(defaults to blackhole :0)
#MacOS
screenrec record --output ~/Desktop/video.mp4 --audio system --duration 60
#Windows
screenrec.exe record --audio system --audio-device "audio=virtual-audio-capturer" --output .\video_demo.mp4

# Configure settings
screenrec config --resolution 1920x1080 --fps 30 --codec h264

# View current configuration
screenrec config

# Clear/reset all saved configuration
screenrec config --clear

### Notes on Audio
- All audio capture is handled directly by ffmpeg via platform-native APIs (avfoundation on macOS, dshow on Windows).
- **Microphone input** (`--audio mic`):
  - **macOS**: 
    - Without `--audio-device`: Defaults to built-in microphone (`:1`)
    - With `--audio-device`: Uses the specified device (e.g., `--audio-device ":1"` for built-in mic, `:2` for external mic)
  - **Windows**:
    - Without `--audio-device`: Defaults to default microphone (`audio=Microphone Array (Intel® Smart Sound Technology for Digital Microphones)`)
    - With `--audio-device`: 
      - macOS-style indices are supported: `--audio-device ":1"` converts to `audio=Microphone Array (Intel® Smart Sound Technology for Digital Microphones)`
      - For specific devices, use full device name: `--audio-device "audio=Microphone Array (Intel® Smart Sound Technology for Digital Microphones)"`
      - To list available devices: `ffmpeg -f dshow -list_devices true -i dummy`
- **System audio** (`--audio system`):
  - **macOS**: Requires a loopback device (e.g., BlackHole, Loopback). 
    - First, list available devices: `ffmpeg -f avfoundation -list_devices true -i ""`
    - Defaults to `:0` (typically BlackHole if installed), or specify: `--audio system --audio-device ":0"`
    - **Note**: Without a loopback device, system audio capture may not work. Consider installing BlackHole or Loopback.
  - **Windows**: 
    - Defaults to `virtual-audio-capturer` for system audio
    - macOS-style `:0` is supported and converts to `audio=virtual-audio-capturer`
    - For specific devices, use full device name: `--audio-device "audio=virtual-audio-capturer"`

### A/V Sync
- Audio and video are automatically synchronized by ffmpeg when using the same input source.
- For indefinite recordings (no `--duration`), stop with Ctrl+C; ffmpeg will finalize the file and maintain sync.

### Notes on Performance
- For best results, use release builds (`cargo build --release`).
- On macOS, hardware video encoding uses `h264_videotoolbox`. On Windows, `libx264` is used with fast preset for real-time encoding.
```

| **macOS M3** | 1920x1080 | 30 | 15-20% | ~180MB | ~41MB | Mic |
| **Windows i5** | 1920x1080 | 30 | ~14.8% | ~100MB | ~13MB | Mic |


### Performance Characteristics
#### ✅ Requirements Met

- ✅ **1080p @ 30 FPS**: Achieved on all test systems
- ✅ **CPU Usage < 30%**: Met on macOS and Windows
- ✅ **Efficient Encoding**: Hardware acceleration on macOS, optimized software encoding on Windows

#### Performance Notes

**macOS:**
- Hardware-accelerated encoding via `h264_videotoolbox` provides excellent performance
- CPU usage remains consistently below 20% for 1080p @ 30 FPS
- System audio capture via BlackHole has minimal performance impact

**Windows:**
- Software encoding via `libx264` with `fast` preset optimized for real-time
- CPU usage typically below 20% for 1080p @ 30 FPS (meets or approaches target)
- Zero-latency tuning ensures minimal encoding delay
- Hardware encoding (`h264_nvenc`) can be used if available for lower CPU usage

#### File Size Optimization

- **WebM (VP9)**: ~0.65-0.75 MB/s at 1080p @ 30 FPS (better compression, slightly higher CPU)
- Audio bitrate: 192kbps (balanced quality/size)

#### Screenshot Performance

- **Capture Time**: < 50ms
- **File Size**: ~5MB (PNG, 4480X2520), ~800KB (JPEG, 4480X2520), ~500KB (PNG, 1920X1080), ~270KB (JPEG, 1920X1080)
- **Memory**: < 50MB during capture

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I use existing screen recording libraries?**
A: Yes! You can use any Rust crates. However, you must build the complete application yourself.

**Q: Do I need to support Linux?**
A: No, only macOS and Windows are required. Linux support is a bonus but not required.

**Q: What if I can't achieve <30% CPU usage?**
A: Document your efforts and optimizations. Explain any trade-offs made.

**Q: Can I submit multiple approaches?**
A: Submit your best solution in a single PR. You can include alternative approaches in branches.

**Q: How is CPU usage measured?**
A: We'll test on standard hardware (M1 MacBook Pro, Windows i7/Ryzen 7). Use Activity Monitor/Task Manager for local testing.

**Q: Should I include binary releases?**
A: No, we'll build from source. Focus on clear build instructions.
