# 🎯 Omega Focus Rust Screen Recording Challenge

Welcome to the Omega Focus technical assessment for Rust developers! This challenge tests your ability to build a high-performance, cross-platform screen recording application.

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

This repository contains a complete implementation of the screen recording challenge.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Build the project (release mode recommended)
cargo build --release

# Take a screenshot
./target/release/screenrec screenshot --output screenshot.png

# Record a 10-second video
./target/release/screenrec record --duration 10 --output recording.ivf

# Record with custom settings
./target/release/screenrec record --fps 30 --quality 8 --audio system
```

### Features Implemented

- ✅ Screenshot capture (PNG/JPEG)
- ✅ Video recording with configurable FPS
- ✅ Audio capture (system audio and microphone)
- ✅ **Idle frame skipping** - automatically skip encoding duplicate frames
- ✅ **Interaction tracking** - capture mouse clicks, movements, and keyboard events
- ✅ Cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- ✅ Performance optimized (target: <30% CPU)
- ✅ Intuitive CLI interface
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ VP8 encoding with IVF container

### Architecture Highlights

- **Async/concurrent design** using Tokio
- **Channel-based pipeline** for frame and audio data
- **Pure Rust VP8 encoding** (no FFmpeg dependency)
- **Cross-platform screen capture** via scrap library
- **Interaction tracking** - capture mouse/keyboard events with timestamps
- **Modular code structure** with clear separation of concerns

See [SOLUTION.md](SOLUTION.md) for comprehensive documentation including:
- Detailed architecture overview
- Build instructions for all platforms
- Usage examples
- Performance benchmarks
- Troubleshooting guide

   - User-configurable settings (resolution, FPS, audio source)

3. **CLI Interface**
   - Simple, intuitive command-line interface
   - Configuration via CLI arguments or config file
   - Start/stop recording controls
   - Status feedback during recording

4. **Cross-Platform Support**
   - Must work on **macOS** and **Windows**
   - Consistent behavior across both platforms

### Performance Requirements

**Critical**: Your solution must meet these performance targets:

- ✅ Record **1080p video at 30 FPS**
- ✅ **CPU usage < 30%** during recording (measured on modern hardware)
- ✅ Minimal memory footprint
- ✅ Efficient video encoding with good quality/size ratio

### Technical Constraints

- **Language**: Rust (latest stable)
- **Starting Point**: Build from scratch
- **Dependencies**: Any Rust crates are allowed
- **Video Format**: MP4 or WebM
- **Audio Format**: AAC, Opus, or similar

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I use existing screen recording libraries?**
A: Yes! You can use any Rust crates. However, you must build the complete application yourself.

**Q: Do I need to support Linux?**
A: No, only macOS and Windows are required. Linux support is a bonus but not required.

**Q: What if I can't achieve <30% CPU usage?**
A: Document your efforts and optimizations. Explain any trade-offs made.

**Q: Can I submit multiple approaches?**
A: Submit your best solution in a single PR. You can include alternative approaches in branches.

**Q: How is CPU usage measured?**
A: We'll test on standard hardware (M1 MacBook Pro, Windows i7/Ryzen 7). Use Activity Monitor/Task Manager for local testing.

**Q: Should I include binary releases?**
A: No, we'll build from source. Focus on clear build instructions.
